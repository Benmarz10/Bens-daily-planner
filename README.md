# Daily-Planner
This is an application that will help the users plan out their work days. The allowed time blocks are from 9am to 5pm, each timeblock is easily readable because of the color coding. Past time blocks will be displayed gray and present in red while future time blocks are displayed green. The user can also input descriptions in each timeblock and save the description.
